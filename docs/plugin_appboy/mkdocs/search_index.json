You can use this method to optionally identify a user with a unique ID.\n\nNote:\n Once you identify a user, you cannot go back to the \"anonymous\" profile. \n\n\nappboyPlugin.changeUser(\"SOME_USER_NAME\");\n\n\n\n\nsetUserInfo\n\n\nThis function allows to set the properties to help identify a user with the id given on the changeUser() method.\nThe available properties to change are:\n\n\nfirstName\n - First name of the user.\n\n\nlastName\n - Last name of the user.\n\n\ngender\n - Gender this can be either \"male\" or \"female\".\n\n\nemail\n - E-mail address for the user.\n\n\ndateOfBirth\n - Birthday date.\n\n\ncountry\n - Country.\n\n\nhomeCity\n - Home City of the user.\n\n\nlanguage\n - Language as 2 Character abreviation string eg. \"EN\", \"ES\", \"PT\".\n\n\nphone\n - Phone number for the user.\n\n\navatarImageURL\n - An URL containing an image for the user to be displayed in their dashboard profile.\n\n\nlocal info = {\n    firstName = \"NAME\",\n    lastName = \"LNAME\",\n    gender = \"male\",\n    email = \"example@somedomain.com\",\n    dateOfBirth = \"04-20-1988\",\n    country = \"Sweeden\",\n    homeCity = \"Stockholm\",\n    language = \"EN\",\n    phone = \"5555555555\",\n    avatarImageURL = \"https://seobits.github.io/img/logobase.png\",\n}\nappboyPlugin.setUserInfo(info);\n\n\n\n\nsetCustomAttribute\n\n\nSet the desired set of custom attributes for the active user with the given keys and values.\n\n\nlocal attributes = {\n    attr1 = \"value\", // string\n    attr2 = 20, // number\n    attr3 = true, // boolean\n    attr4 = 20.88 // float\n}\nappboyPlugin.setCustomAttribute(attributes);\n\n\n\n\nflushDataAndProcessRequestQueue\n\n\nEnqueues a data flush request for the current user and immediately starts processing the network queue. Note that if the queue already contains another request for the current user, that the new data flush request will be merged into the already existing request and only one will execute for that user.\n\n\nappboyPlugin.flushDataAndProcessRequestQueue();\n\n\n\n\nlogCustomEvent\n\n\nAdds an app specific event to event tracking log that's lazily pushed up to the server. \n\n\nThis method allows for sending custom event with properties attached, simply add a table with the desired properties as a second parameter.\n\n\nappboyPlugin.logCustomEvent(\"SOME_CUSTOM_EVENT\"); --Custom Event\nappboyPlugin.logCustomEvent(\"SOME_CUSTOM_EVENT\", {customPropertyFoo = \"foo\", customPropertyBar = \"bar\"}); --Custom event with properties\n\n\n\n\nlogPurchase\n\n\nLogs a purchase made in the application, this method receives a table with the folowing mandatory properties:\n\n\nname\n - String to identify the purchase.\n\n\ncurrency\n - Currency of the purchase.\n\n\nprice\n - Price of the purchase.\n\n\nThe following are optional properties you can add to the table depending on the product you want to log\n\n\nquantity\n - Number of products purchased.\n\n\nproperties\n - Extra properties\n\n\nNote:\n Appboy supports purchases in multiple currencies. Purchases that you report in a currency other than USD will be shown in the dashboard in USD based on the exchange rate at the date they were reported.\n\n\nBasic purchase logging\n\n\nlocal purchaseProperties = {\n    name = \"SOME_PURCHASE\",\n    currency = \"USD\",\n    price = 9.99,\n}\nappboyPlugin.logPurchase(purchaseProperties);\n\n\n\n\nExtended purchase logging\n\n\nlocal purchaseProperties = {\n    name = \"SOME_PURCHASE\",\n    currency = \"USD\",\n    price = 0.99,\n    quantity = 10,\n    properties = {\n        customPropertyFoo = \"foo\",\n        customPropertyBar = \"foo\",\n    }\n}\nappboyPlugin.logPurchase(purchaseProperties);",
